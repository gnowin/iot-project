# TIG-Stack

## Before starting the stack

If you have just cloned or downloaded the repository, you need to change the "CHANGEME" values in the ```.env``` file. There are comments in the file explaining what the different values should be.

## How to use

In your terminal, navigate to the folder where this ```README``` belongs. If you want to start the stack, run:

```console
docker compose up -d 
```

When you want to stop the stack, run this in the same folder:

```console
docker compose down
```
